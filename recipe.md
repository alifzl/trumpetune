# What is a Recipe?

- In order to serve a model via trumpetune, files `example.py`, `predictor.py` and optional `requirements.txt`, `extras.sh` needs to be added to our existing python scripts (a.k.a ML codes).


# predictor.py

```python

def predictor.py(list_of_inputs, batch_size=1):
    
    return list_of_outputs
    
```


# example.py

```python
example = [INPUT]

```
